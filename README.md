This project aims as watering the garden base not simply based on a timer but based on the conditions.  Should be able to operate during spring and summer. 
It uses oppen-weather map to view at the current and weather forecast. It includes additional sensors for real-time measurement.
The there is an algoritme to estimate the time the gareden need to be watered.

the hardware is a combo of a rasberry-pi, the central unit. Then there are va;ves making 2 segments in the garden that are controlled by an esp32.   
Around the pool a seperate esp32 measures temperature and controlls the pool-pumps
